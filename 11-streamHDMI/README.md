**Abstract**

This is a project based on digilent's "hdmi_in" demo. The demo stream from HDMI to VGA, this work proposes a capture card in a similar way, where in addition to VGA should be streamed video by sockets.

## Project content

* [c_sources](./c_sources/) - Contains the C projects of this project
  * [hdmi-in](./c_sources/hdmi-in/) - Contains the digilent demo project, which is an application that puts the HDMI (input) in the VGA (output)
  * [UDP-client-perf](./c_sources/UDP-client-perf/) - Contains the demo project of xilinx, which is a performace client application with UDP sockets
  * [stream](./c_sources/stream/) - Contains the project that consists in accomplishing the objective of this project, VGA stream via sockets, where the VGA is the HDMI in.
* [python_sources](./python_sources/) - Contains the Python files of this project, to receive the data by sockets
* [HDL_sources](./HDL_sources/) - Contains the necessary files to generate the hardware project
* [blockDesign_hdmi_to_vga.tcl](./blockDesign_hdmi_to_vga.tcl) - File to generate the block design
* [hdmi_to_vga.bit](./hdmi_to_vga.bit) - Bitstream of generated hardware
* [hdmi_to_vga_wrapper.hdf](./hdmi_to_vga_wrapper.hdf) - The hardware file, this contain the bitstream
* [project_hdmi_to_vga_dump.tcl](./project_hdmi_to_vga_dump.tcl) - File to generate the complete vivado project

First you need to create the design project, this can be done at tcl console by:

```bash
source project_hdmi_to_vga_dump.tcl
```

this go create the design project, so now at interface or in console you need generate the [design file](./hdmi_to_vga_wrapper.hdf). This can do the same for all other projects, you just need to **generate the bitstream** in the graphical interface or the tcl console. After generate the bitstream is need **export hardware** with the bitstream (in graphical interface of vivado 2019.1, you can do this in File > Export > Export Hardware).



With the **hardware** file exported previously, just go to *xilinx sdk application* and create a new empty project with the **hardware target**>**hardware platform** configured with the [design file](./hdmi_to_vga_wrapper.hdf) and **hardware target**>**CPU** configured with **ps7_cortexa9_0**. 

**Note:** It is important to make sure that your **hardware platform** is configured correctly, with the hardware generate by the project at xilinx vivado.

After this, you need have a project with the *hardware platform*, *bsp* and a main project where go the *C* files. At the main project is need include the [c_sources](./c_sources/). 

* **hardware platform:** is the project with the hardware make in xilinx vivado and export previusly
* **bsp:** this is a project generate with the libs compatible with the hardware generate
* **main:** this is where go the project.

To test if the design is correct, you should use the [hdmi-in](../08-HDMI_demo/c_sources/hdmi-in/) [demo project](https://github.com/Digilent/Zybo-hdmi-in) to check if the project to capture HDMI and put it on the VGA output. It can also be tested the socket issue, through the demo project available in the SDK, the [UDP client perf](../08-HDMI_demo/c_sources/UDP-client-perf/).


After compile this project, with the zybo connected you can program the FPGA (at Xilinx SDK, you can go in Xilinx > program FPGA checks the infos and program the FPGA). With the FPGA programed you can lauch on hardware the *C* project (at Xilinx SDK, click on the **main project** go at menu in Run > Run as > Lauch on hardware (System debuger)). 


With this the FPGA have our project, to use this demo you can connect with serial port with the configurations: 

* Port: depend where is connected the zybo (COMX)
* Baud rate: 115200
* Data bits: 8
* Stop bits: 1
* Parit: None
* Flow control: None

if all is correct the menu like the figure is show at the serial terminal:
